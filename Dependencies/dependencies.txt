Dependencies\Code
We need to copy the following folders to this folder:

GLFW\include\GLFW\
glm\glm\
glew\include\GL\
slang\include\
spirv_cross\ that includes:
	GLSL.std.450.h
	spirv.hpp
	spirv_cfg.hpp
	spirv_common.hpp
	spirv_cross.hpp
	spirv_cross_containers.hpp
	spirv_cross_error_handling.hpp
	spirv_cross_parsed_ir.hpp
	spirv_glsl.hpp
	spirv_parser.hpp
from spirv-cross (repository: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross/)

slang library (repository: https://github.com/shader-slang/slang)

--------------- Note: --------------- 
for now we need spirv-cross compiled(clone for repo, run CMake -B build) for debug and release as release versions are from 08/2021.
I don't think I can provide compiled binaries here, so you need to compile them by yourself until I find a better solution.


Dependencies\Libraries
We need to copy the following files to this folder:
GLFW\lib-vc2019\glfw3.lib
glew\lib\Release\x64\glew32s.lib
slang libraries folder that contains slang.lib & gfx.lib

spirv-cross-core.lib is the debug compiled version of spirv-cross
spirv-cross-core.pdb
spirv-cross-glsl.lib is the debug compiled version of spirv-cross-glsl
spirv-cross-glsl.pdb

spirv-cross-corer.lib is the release compiled version of spirv-cross
spirv-cross-glslr.lib is the release compiled version of spirv-cross-glsl

if you miss one of the two sets of files required will break the respective build. 

Dependencies\Binaries
slang folder: gfx.dll, gfx.slang, slang.dll, slang-slang, slang-glslang.dll, slang-glsl-module.dll
